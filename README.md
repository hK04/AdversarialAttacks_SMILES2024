The results are located in the `/Final Results` folder and can be accessed using `Plot-sample.ipynb`.

To add more files with attack results, follow the given structure:

```
Dataset1
    Model1
        PGD
            aa_res_Dataset1_100.csv
        SimBA
            aa_res_Dataset1_100.csv
    Model2
        PGD
            aa_res_Dataset1_100.csv
        SimBA
            aa_res_Dataset1_100.csv
```


## Quick Start

If you want to work with project with Docker, you can use folder **docker_scripts**.
Firstly copy file `credentials_example` to `credentials` and tune it with your variables for running docker. After you need to make docker image using command:

```
cd docker_scripts
bash build
```

For creating container run:

```
bash launch_container
```

All the requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`
For install all packages run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After you need to create folders `checkpoints` for saving classifier weights and `results` for saving adversarial attacks results.

Where are three basic steps: train classifier, attack model, train discriminator.
To run these steps you need to change assosiated config files in "config" folder and after that run assosiated python scrits `train_classifier.py`, `attack_run.py` and `train_discriminator.py`.

For example:
```
python train_classifier.py
```
## Describtion

The goal of the project is to create hardly detected adversarial attacks for time-series models.
